Example:
./run.sh 172.16.124.20 admin kedacomIPC a5s/s2/his3535/his3518/xxx/(named as you like)

Resoult:
Resoults in "resoult" dir,such as "a5s_test_report.txt" "s2_test_report.txt" "his3535_test_report.txt" ...

Legacy:
1."/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes" is not in the resoult;
	Because this arg can't be larger than 10M.It's different between different devices.I have no idea now.
